# Ticket Breakdown Guidelines

Tickets are the executable units of convergence. The plan points at the next ticket; the ticket defines the next verifiable result. Everything below applies whether the tickets land as OpenSpec changes or as plain markdown files.

## Three levels

| Level | What it is | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Epic | A capability area of the product | A field on the ticket |
| User Story | One thing a person can do | A field on the ticket |
| Task | One implementable slice of a story | The ticket itself — one file, one change |

Only the Task level becomes a file. Epic and Story are labels that let anyone group the tickets back into a map, and they are what make coverage checkable — a story with no tickets under it is a story nobody is building.

## The slicing axis

**Cut by what someone can do, not by which layer the code sits in.**

A ticket is one narrow path through every layer it needs — schema, logic, screen, tests — and it is demoable or verifiable on its own once done. A ticket that delivers "all the API endpoints" or "the whole data model" is a horizontal slice: nothing works until every other layer lands, and nobody can tell whether it is correct.

Rules:

- Every ticket title reads as "<who> can <do what>". A title whose subject is a module, a layer or a technology gets rewritten.
- Test each ticket: once this is done, can anyone see or use the difference? If not, it is not a feature ticket — see the two exceptions below.
- Layers still decide the order **inside** one ticket: schema first, then logic, then screen. Never use layers to split the ticket set.

When the work arrived through a plan document, its scope items were already written this way and each one maps to a story. When it did not, do that rewrite here before slicing.

## Exception 1 — shared foundations

Project scaffolding, auth, the design system, and core tables that several stories sit on are not things a user can do, but they still have to exist. Collect them into one foundation ticket rather than smearing them across whichever features happen to touch them first, and give every ticket that needs them a blocking edge back to it.

One foundation ticket per shared base. Do not create one for an Epic whose stories share nothing — a small Epic split this way just gets an empty ticket at the front.

## Exception 2 — wide refactors

A wide refactor is one mechanical change — rename a column, retype a shared symbol — whose blast radius fans across the codebase, so a single edit breaks call sites everywhere and no vertical slice can land green. Sequence it as expand–contract instead:

1. **Expand** — add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks.
2. **Migrate** — move call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), one ticket per batch, each blocked by the expand. CI stays green because the old form still exists.
3. **Contract** — delete the old form once no caller remains, blocked by every migrate batch.

When even the batches cannot stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch, and have all of them block one final integrate-and-verify ticket. Green is promised only there.

## Blocking edges

Every ticket declares the tickets that must finish before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately; the tickets whose blockers are all done are the frontier, and anything on the frontier is safe to pick up.

Draw an edge only where one ticket genuinely gates another — a shared table, an auth boundary, a contract the other side calls. "It would be tidier in this order" is not a blocking edge; it inflates the graph until nothing looks startable.

## Coverage check

After slicing, go back over the per-feature analysis (1b-1d) and assign every row to exactly one ticket:

- each row of the error/rescue map
- each shadow path
- each interaction edge case

A row no ticket owns is a missing ticket, not an oversight to fix later. A row owned by two tickets means their boundary is unclear — redraw it. The same check applies upward: every story has at least one ticket, and the tickets under a story cover its whole acceptance criteria.

## Where the tickets land

Ask once, at the start of the run, and use the answer for the rest of the session.

### Plain markdown (default)

One file per ticket under `docs/tickets/`, numbered from `01` in dependency order:

```md
# 07 — 客人可以選擇服務項目與時段

**Epic:** 預約流程
**User Story:** 客人可以完成一次預約
**Blocked by:** 01 專案骨架, 04 服務項目資料表
**Status:** ready

## What it delivers
[The end-to-end behaviour this makes work, from the user's side.]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...
```

This is a location `dev-task-loop` can be pointed at when it asks where the backlog lives.

### OpenSpec

When the project has an `openspec/` directory and the `openspec` CLI is available, one ticket is one change — never one task, or you get a change per line item. The ticket's acceptance criteria become the change's requirements and scenarios; the ordering inside one ticket belongs in its `tasks.md`.

OpenSpec has no dependency relationship *between* changes — its dependency graph runs between the artifacts inside a single change. So the blocking edges live in `delivery-status.md`: map each change to one milestone id and let the milestone order carry the sequence. Do not invent a `blocked by` field inside the change; nothing validates it and it will drift.

The foundation rule is ours, not OpenSpec's. OpenSpec deliberately treats changes as parallel and gate-free, and will not stop anyone from starting a change whose foundation is unbuilt. We simply do not start it.

## Avoid

- One ticket for an entire phase, or one mixing unrelated capabilities.
- File paths and code snippets in the ticket body — they go stale fast. The exception is a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (a state machine, a schema, a type shape); trim it to the decision, not a working demo.
- A ticket that cannot be validated on its own.
- A plan that points at a vague bucket like `backend cleanup`.

## Quality checks

- The next agent can pick one ticket off the frontier and start without re-planning.
- Every ticket title survives the "can anyone see or use the difference" test, or is one of the two exceptions.
- Ticket size is small enough that done-or-not-done is not a judgement call.
- Every story has ticket coverage; every error path, shadow path and edge case has exactly one owner.
- Blocking edges reflect real gates, not preferred order.
