## Overview

Design architecture and verifiable tickets, or review an existing UI. Preserve the requested scope and existing project decisions.

## Command routing

Infer the mode from the requested outcome:

- Architecture, module boundaries, technical plans, or tickets: read [Engineering workflow](references/engineering-workflow.md) in full before the per-feature analysis, including its examples.
- UI critique, design review, or AI slop scan: read [Design review workflow](references/design-review-workflow.md) in full before reviewing, including its examples.
- If both are requested, use both workflows for their respective outputs. Ask which mode only when the intended outcome remains materially ambiguous.

Read the other references at the workflow step that needs them.

## Shared decision rules

Use evidence from the project and prior user decisions. Analyze each feature's flow, failure paths, boundaries, and testing approach before consolidating the architecture.

Collect unresolved decisions that require user tradeoffs and present related choices together with a recommendation and consequences. Ask before changing agreed scope, architecture, workflows, or other consequential choices that are not authorized. Continue independent analysis while awaiting answers. Reuse settled decisions without asking again.

A request for review or discussion produces the corresponding analysis. An authorized implementation or ticket-writing request permits routine work within its agreed boundaries.

## Project records

Use existing documents and task systems that serve the purposes below. When no arrangement exists and full development handoff is needed, create `ENG.md`, `delivery-status.md`, ticket files, `AGENTS.md`, and the `CLAUDE.md` pointer. For a bounded architecture decision or UI review, select the records needed for the requested outcome.

| File or location | Purpose | When to create or update | When to read |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ENG.md` | Shared architecture, testing strategy, assumptions, and migration order across tickets | When shared technical decisions need to persist | Before changing the relevant architecture, testing strategy, or migrations |
| `delivery-status.md` | Current progress, blockers, next verifiable output, and next ticket | When ongoing tracking or handoff is needed; update as relevant state changes | On arrival to pick up work |
| `docs/tickets/` or the existing ticket system | Each ticket's deliverable, acceptance criteria, and blocking dependencies | When asked to break down work or prepare development handoff | Read the assigned ticket and its dependencies before implementation |
| `AGENTS.md` | Project working rules and the locations and reading triggers of supporting records | When establishing coordination or changing working rules | Before starting project work |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Entry point directing agents to `AGENTS.md` | When establishing the default coordination setup; keep actual rules in `AGENTS.md` | As an entry point to the project rules |
| `DESIGN.md` | Visual baseline for UI review | This skill reads it; it does not create or overwrite it | Before reviewing the UI against the design baseline |
| `DESIGN-REVIEW.md` | UI scores, unresolved findings, and component review results | When a persistent review is needed and no existing arrangement covers it; update on subsequent reviews | Before re-reviewing the UI |


Read existing content before updating it, preserve unrelated sections, and register actual artifact paths with when they must be read. Keep shared technical decisions in the architecture record and per-ticket acceptance criteria on the owning ticket.

## Completion check

- The result answers the requested architecture, ticketing, or UI-review need.
- Engineering analysis covers feature flows, failures, interaction boundaries, testing, and applicable migration risks; ticketing work assigns every analyzed acceptance item an owner and records real blockers.
- Unresolved assumptions and decisions are explicit. Project-required validation and delivery rules are followed.
- Updated records retain unrelated content, link to the actual sources, and identify the next verifiable action when handing off.
