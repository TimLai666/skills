# Tracking Templates

Read before first creating a dashboard or concept tracker. Preserve existing filenames and learning history. Localize new content to the user’s language.

## Dashboard Template

Create when no dashboard exists. Filename localized to `{LANG}`. Example in English:

```markdown
# Learning Dashboard

> Concept-based metacognition tracking. See linked files for details.
